# This workflow automatically creates a PR to apache/dubbo-go-pixiu-samples
# when a PR is merged into the main branch of this repository.

# Prerequisites:
# - Configure the UPSTREAM_GITHUB_TOKEN secret in repository settings
# - Token should have 'public_repo' permission
# - Recommended: use a dedicated bot account for the token

            ### Action Required
          
            Manual intervention is needed to resolve conflicts and create the upstream PR.
          
            ### Steps to resolve:
          
            1. Checkout the main branch
            2. Create a new branch: \`git checkout -b manual-sync-${PR_NUMBER}\`
            3. Add upstream: \`git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/dubbo-go-pixiu-samples.git\`
            4. Fetch upstream: \`git fetch upstream main\`
            5. Rebase: \`git rebase upstream/main\`
            6. Resolve conflicts manually
            7. Push and create PR to apache/dubbo-go-pixiu-samples
          
            cc @${PR_AUTHOR}" \
            --label "sync-failure,needs-attention"
          
          echo "‚ùå Rebase failed. Issue created for manual resolution."
